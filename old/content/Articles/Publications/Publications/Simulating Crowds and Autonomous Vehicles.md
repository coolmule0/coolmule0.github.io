Self driving vehicles are gaining greater relevance, and there are many problems that need tackling before they can be more commonly used. One of the best ways to understand problems is to be able to visualise it. This paper presents a way of seeing on-screen and in VR the effects of people and autonomous pod-like vehicles within the same space. 


The image below shows a snapshot of the visualisation. The pod is that from Transport Systems Catapult in Milton Keynes.
