A talk for [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com/), a place to bring science communication to the public over a pint of beer in the pub. I talked about my work on deep learning, and how it can be applied to the detection of early cancer formation. 

A wonderfully fun event where I chatted with a range of people from fellow researchers in different interesting fields, to enthusiastic people with wildy interesting views and perspective. The whole event gave me new perspective on my work and helped me take it in directions I would not have considered otherwise.

A highlight for me was the creation of a paper robot-plan named the 'Wombot', named for the numerous wombats present in my presentation.
