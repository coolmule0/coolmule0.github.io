Title: Batched linear programing in 2D on the GPU
Slug: Batch Linear Programming Code
Date: 2019-04-01

An algorithm based of Seidel's randomised incremental linear program, optimised for GPUs in 2D. It is able to efficiently solve large numbers of different linear programs. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coolmule0/LP) for source code.
