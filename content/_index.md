Welcome to my site, a little place I store info about projects I have been a part of, and what kind of work I like doing.

Currently I am working on fusion energy, and trying to help make fusion energy a reality.

I love computing and simulations. The idea of creating a virtual world, and being able to poke and bend any and every rule is very satisfying as well as a great way to learn more about real systems.
