I talked about my work on deep learning, and how it can be applied to the detection of early cancer formation.
A wonderfully fun event where I chatted with a range of people from fellow researchers in different interesting fields, to enthusiastic people with wildy interesting views and perspective.</description></item><item><title>Computer Graphics International 2019</title><link>https://coolmule0.github.io/talks/cgi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 11:40:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coolmule0.github.io/talks/cgi/</guid><description>CGI 2019 conference that took place in Calgary, Canada. 4 days of information, presentations, and gathering of computer graphics research.
